### This is my clone of the IMDB app, written in react native it works with both android and ios devices.

This uses the TMDB API to get results. Each API call only loads 50 movies/actors information. So when a user is scrolling through, at the end of 50 a new API call is issued. Because of this there is never loading times in retrieving information.
